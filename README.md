# Accessible responsive form

In this example, we'll create a form that a customer can use to update their delivery and billing addresses.

## Part 1: Form structure

1. Create a `form` element. Give it an `action` attribute with a value of `#`.

2. Create an `input` element. Give it a `type` attribute with the value `submit`, and a `value` attribute with the value `Update addresses`. This element should stay at the end of the form.
